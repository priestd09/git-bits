These are utilities for working with git, including some higher-level commands
to support certain workflows.

They rely on Git's behaviour of hooking into your PATH and turning any command
"git-foo" into a git subcommand "git foo".

They are (obviously) undocumented and unsupported right now, so YMMV.
Happy to discuss them - Github-message me.
