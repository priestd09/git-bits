# Merges a feature branch into the current branch, then deletes the feature

# Always creates a merge commit to show the merge history, and prompts you to
# enter a message for the merge commit (so you can comment on what the
# merged-in feature does or what it's for, at a higher level than the
# implementation commits in the feature branch itself).
#
# e.g.
#   git merge-feature new-widgets
